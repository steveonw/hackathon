# Experiment protocol

## Question

Does the path into ternary space affect how much behavior a pretrained model
retains?

### v1 — independent 27 -> 9 -> 3

The first experiment used independently rescaled 27-, 9-, and 3-level weight
grids with a tiny recovery budget. It did not show a staged advantage and was
numerically unstable near ternary.

Remote run: \`6ac52475404719ba37661c8b\`.

### v2 — strict nested balanced-ternary ancestry

v2 used a literal balanced-ternary hierarchy with one inherited scale:

- 27 child states,
- 9 parent states,
- 3 ternary grandparent states.

Raw direct and nested projections ended identically, as expected for
deterministic nested projection without adaptation. Recovery became stable, but
direct ternary QAT still beat the staged route.

## v3 — transition schedules and high-precision preparation

v3 tests whether the path into ternary space matters more than a hard sequence
of discrete codebooks. All variants start from the same BF16-rounded checkpoint
and keep trainable FP32 master weights. The ternary forward quantizer uses a
learnable per-output-row scale, and recovery uses WikiText-2 with CE + teacher
KL distillation.

The schedules are:

- direct: 600 fully ternary steps;
- soft: a 200-step quantization-strength ramp followed by 400 ternary steps;
- up/down equal-total: 200 full-precision adaptation steps followed by 400
  ternary steps;
- up/down equal-final: 200 full-precision adaptation steps followed by 600
  ternary steps.

The up/down treatment is the practical version of a proposed 16->24->3 idea.
FP32 has a 24-bit significand; merely upcasting BF16 cannot recover discarded
bits, so the experimental variable is **adaptation while the master weights are
stored and updated at FP32 precision** before the ternary switch.
