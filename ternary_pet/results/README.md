## Current headline

The 9->3 treatment has now beaten direct ternary in **three paired training
orders** on the fixed evaluator.

Perplexity reductions were **56.95%, 49.30%, and 53.80%**. Teacher top-1 gains
were **+7.65, +8.31, and +6.64 percentage points**. KL was also lower in all
three cases.

This is reproducible evidence for the staged effect on this setup, not yet a
claim of generality or a usable ternary checkpoint.
