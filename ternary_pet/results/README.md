## Current headline

v6 isolates the small-budget 9->3 advantage to the **prepared FP32 master
weights**.

All four branches keeping the prepared masters finish around loss 5.18-5.21 /
PPL 178-182, regardless of whether prepared scales or Adam state are retained.

The direct control is loss 5.875 / PPL 355.90.

The new same-data diagnostic also shows that Q9 training changes **0.6755%** of
future ternary assignments even when the original scales are held fixed.
